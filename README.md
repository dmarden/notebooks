## Collection of Jupyter notebooks

To view notebooks online visit [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trichter/notebooks/tree/master/notebooks/).

To run through notebooks locally clone the notebooks repository or download the zip file.
Navigate to the notebooks folder and run `jupyter notebook` to play with the code and the data.
Dependencies of the notebooks are:

* [ObsPy](http://www.obspy.org)
* [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)
* [obspyh5](https://github.com/trichter/obspyh5)
* [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm)

All notebooks require ObsPy to be installed. The other dependencies are only required by subsets of the notebooks.
